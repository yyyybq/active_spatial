Spatial Potential Field Module

This module implements task-specific scoring functions that create a continuous
"potential field" for spatial navigation tasks. Given any camera pose (position + 
orientation), the scoring function returns a value in [0, 1] indicating how well
the current state satisfies the task objective.

Key Design Principles:
======================
1. **Dense Rewards**: Every position has a score, enabling gradient-based learning
2. **Task-Specific Geometry**: Each task type has its own geometric scoring logic
3. **Dual Components**: Score = Position Score × α + Orientation Score × β
4. **Smooth Gradients**: Use smooth functions (Gaussian, sigmoid) to avoid discontinuities

Task Types and Their Scoring Logic:
===================================
1. Absolute Positioning (CIRCLE): Score based on distance deviation from target radius
2. Delta Control (POINT): Score based on distance to exact target point
3. Equidistance (LINE): Score based on difference |dist_A - dist_B|
4. Projective Relations (HALF_PLANE): Score based on signed distance to boundary
5. Centering (RAY): Score based on angular centering of A between B and C
6. Occlusion Alignment (RAY): Score based on alignment with occlusion ray
7. FoV Inclusion (ANNULUS): Score based on both objects being in field of view
8. Size-Distance Invariance (CURVE): Score based on apparent size ratio
9. Screen Occupancy (CIRCLE): Score based on object's screen coverage
